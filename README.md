Screenshots of app:

It is finally underway, the app made for choreographers, by choreographers. With the app in its current state, you should be able to log in, access your dashboard and a few choreographic works. As of now, all you can do is view the steps for pieces you are authorized to see. This app was made using postgres for backend data, and express, react, javascript, html, and css for the client side app.

I hope you have a fun time graphing!
