It is finally underway, the app made for choreographers, by choreographers. With the app in its current state, you should be able to log in, access your dashboard and a few choreographic works. As of now, all you can do is view the steps for pieces you are authorized to see. This app was made using postgres for backend data, and express, react, javascript, html, and css for the client side app.

*Note* At this user level, you are not allowed to adjust pieces or steps. That ability is reserved for choreographers or administrators. You are technically a dancer receiving data from your choreographer and must make requests to a choreographer for updates to your steps or piece accessibility. If you would like to upgrade to a choreographer's account, your account type is in the works. Or if you currently move for Angela of STUDIO6, reach out to her for updated piece steps and assignments.

Happy Graphing!
